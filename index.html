					<h3>Christmas Parade is still on!</h3>
					<p>Listen to Christmas songs and sing along in Elk Point, Alberta, because Winter Wonderland Parade is still on! Get into the Christmas mood by viewing the brilliant and stunning show of 27 trees, a hugely inflated arch, and a Grinch-driven hot rod that began last Friday evening and will continue all throughout the holiday season and New Year’s. They are located along the Iron Horse Trail Staging area across the Eco Centre all the way to the log cabin.</p>
					<p>On parade night, many establishments extend their hours and have special sales or activities, and there are additional added attractions this year. Those who wish to participate will not be required to register. Entries should just line up at the EcoCentre between 5 and 6 p.m. The parade will travel along Main Street on its regular path. At the Eco Centre, the Elk Point Lions will provide hot dogs and hot chocolate. From 5 to 8 p.m., the Seniors Recreation Centre will host a pancake supper with the Elk Point Skating Club flipping the flapjacks to help raise funds to replace the ageing and problematic ice plant at A. G. Ross Arena, and the Christian Community Church will host coffee and a Christmas flea market following the parade.</p>
					<p>This year, there will be new entrants. You may anticipate two from the Chamber of Commerce's Rona and Hahn Welding, Second Time Finds, the Christian Community Church's Mountain Movers Youth Group, and two more from other new members. Cam and Diane Peifer will set up a memorial tree where anyone who have a friend or family member are asked to place an ornament in remembrance of loved ones, which will be a completely new and unique concept.</p>
					<p>So what are you waiting for? Make sure to prepare for everything because this year will be a truly magical Christmas season for everyone of all ages to enjoy!</p>
